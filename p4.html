The role of computer engineering in facing the Corona virus<br>
And because of this scourge caused by panic and loss of life, the current trend in the whole world has become at all levels to confront this disease medically and scientifically, so the role of engineering and technology came to besiege this virus<br>
The problem of how computers can help monitor the COVID-19 pandemicis being put to artificial intelligence ( AI) experts around the globeThe AI tools can be
of assistance in many different ways These are used to forecast the spread of the coronavirus, to map its genetic evolution as it transmits from human to human, to speedup diagnosis and to establish new therapies, while also helping policymakers tackle relevant concerns, such as the effect on transport, food supplies and travel<br>
But AI is only useful in all those situations if it has enough examples to learn from
As COVID-19 has brought the world to unchartered territories, the "deep learning" systems that computers use to gain new skills don't actually have the data they need to deliver useful outputsOne of the most important methods used in technology is the work of phoneapplications that take place on mobile devices and follow-up of the disease, as well as the use of electronic devices to check the human temperature and identify whether it is infected or sound healthy and also Robust statistical models based on AI play an important role in helping policy makers understand how COVID-19 spreads and when infection rates are likely to peak By drawing on field data, such as death numbers, AI models can help detect how many infections are in the dark, "he adds, referring to undetected cases that are still infectiousThe data can then be used to warn quarantine zone establishment and other social distancing steps.
It is also the case that AI-based diagnoses can be quickly repurposed to diagnose COVID-19 infections, which are applied in related areas Behold.ai, which has an algorithm for automatically detecting both lung cancer and X-ray collapsed lungs,
announced on Monday that the algorithm could classify COVID-19 patients' chest X-rays as 'abnormal' easily
This instant triage could potentially speed up the diagnosis and ensure that resources are properly allocated. All of these methods contributed directly to confronting and restricting the virus in a number of countries, most notably China and Germany. As is the case in most life matters, everything, if there are advantages and successes as it has falls and disadvantages, and this table shows the difference between the use of technology means prepared and supervised by the highest engineers
